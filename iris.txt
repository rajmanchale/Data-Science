This model reads iris data from the dataset and uses it to train and the test the model.
After it gets trained, the model can predict to which class/species new unknown data will belong to.
Note:
    * Uses GaussianNB algorithm for classification
    * Uses PCA(principle component analysis) for dimensionality reduction
    * seaborn is used to plot graphs
    * Accuracy is ~97%
